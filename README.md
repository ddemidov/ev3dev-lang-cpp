# C++ language bindings for ev3dev

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp)

## Compiling

* EV3:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DEV3DEV_PLATFORM=EV3
make
```

* BrickPi:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DEV3DEV_PLATFORM=RPI
make
```

You have several options for compiling.

## Cross-compiling

You can use a cross-compiling toolchain to create ARM compatible code. Note:
You need a Linux toolchain, not a "bare-metal" toolchain. If it does not have
"linux" in the name, it probably won't work.

Pros: Fastest option. Works on Windows and Mac without a virtual machine.

Cons: Only includes standard libraries - no Debian `-dev` packages.

### Windows

[MentorGraphics toolchain](http://sourcery.mentor.com/public/gnu_toolchain/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2014.05-29-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.exe) (formerly known as CodeSourcery).

### Windows 10

Windows 10 supports the Windows Subsystem for Linux which allows us to install and execute the entire compiler toolchain. The steps required to compile native-mode EV3 applications on Windows 10 is as follows:

1. Be sure that your Windows 10 installation has Windows Subsystem for Linux installed. To install it, go to Control Panel --> Programs and Features --> Turn Windows Feature On/Off and check the box next to Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta).

2. Fire up the bash shell by pressing Start Key, type `bash` and press `Enter`. This will open up Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.

3. Install the ARM compiler by typing `sudo apt-get install arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc`.

4. Use `git clone` to clone this repository to the directory of your choice, e.g.,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp.git
```

will clone the repo into a directory called `/ev3dev-lang-cpp.git`.

5. You need to make some changes to the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file. First, go into the directory

```sh
cd ev3dev-lang-cpp
```
Now, edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file with a text editor of your choice, e.g.,

```sh
vi CMakeLists.txt
```

Just after the `project(...)` declaration, set the C/C++ compilers by adding the following lines:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CC_COMPILER "arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "arm-linux-gnueabi-g++")
```

Alternatively, you can set these environment variables during compilation (explained later).

6. Now compile your programs and the generated binaries will be ready for EV3. This assumes that you have build tools such as `make` and `cmake` installed - if not, install them with `sudo apt-get install build-essential` (for make) and `sudo apt-get install cmake` for cmake. You can then perform compilation by invoking the following commands:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DEV3DEV_PLATFORM=EV3
make
```

If you did not set the variables in the `CMakeLists.txt` file, use the following commands instead:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
CC=arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc CXX=arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ cmake ..
make
```

7. The `build` directory will now contain folders with binary files ready to be executed on the EV3 brick. The easiest way to copy files is to use a program that supports SFTP, such as Filezilla. Remember that, by default, the username of the host system is `robot` and password is `maker`. The location of the path where the files are kept on disk is likely the following:

```
c:\users\<YOUR USERNAME>\appdata\local\lxss\home\<YOUR USERNAME>\ev3dev-lang-cpp\build\
```

8. Be sure to `chmod u+x myprogram` for every copied program before running the program, otherwise you'll get an `Access Denied` in SSH or some really weird error if executing from the brick.

### Mac

[Carlson-Minot toolchain](http://www.carlson-minot.com/available-arm-gnu-linux-g-lite-builds-for-mac-os-x/mac-os-x-arm-gnu-linux-g-lite-201405-29-toolchain)


## Brickstrap

Brickstrap uses QEMU to create a virtual environment (not exactly a virtual
machine) that can run the same ARM compatible code on a different type of
computer.

Pros: Faster than running on the EV3 itself. Can install all Debian `-dev`
packages using `apt-get`.

Cons: Slower than cross-compiler. Requires Linux (Ubuntu).

See [this page](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/wiki/Using-brickstrap-to-cross-compile-and-debug) for instructions.


## On the Brick

It is possible to compile programs on the EV3 brick itself.

Pros: Easy to setup.

Cons: Really slow.

Just run `sudo apt-get install build-essential` on the EV3 and you will have
everything you need.
